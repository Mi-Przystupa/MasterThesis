\chapter{Lay Summary}

In this work, we consider the question of how to better encode complex information between languages (such as the latent semantic meaning of sentences) in order to improve machine translation systems. In previous work this is accomplished by introducing continuous random variables which are assumed to have simple probability distributions. We build on these works by enabling these distributions to be more flexible with a class of machine learning functions referred to as normalizing flows. Normalizing flows are functions which are invertible, or for some flows at least provably so, and can transform simple distributions into complex ones. Our results would suggest \reminder{insert what happens after experiments}

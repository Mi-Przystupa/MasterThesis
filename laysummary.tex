\chapter{Lay Summary}

In this work, we consider the question of how to better encode complex information between languages (such as the latent semantic meaning of sentences) in order to improve machine translation systems. In previous work this is accomplished by introducing continuous random variables which are assumed to have simple probability distributions. We extend these works by enabling these distributions to be more flexible beyond these simple distribution by adding normalizing flows. These are invertible functions that can help transform simple distributions into complex ones. Normalizing flows have previously been quite helpful in other areas of artificial intelligence including computer vision. Our results would suggest \reminder{insert what happens after experiments}

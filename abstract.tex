\chapter{Abstract}

Incorporating latent variables in neural machine translation systems allows explicit representations for lexical and semantic information. These representations help improve general translation quality, as well as provide more robust longer sentence and out-of-domain translations. Previous work has focused on using variational inference with isotropic Gaussian distributions, which we hypothesize cannot sufficiently encode latent factors of language which could exhibit multi-modal distributive behavior. Normalizing flows are an approach that enable more flexible posterior distribution estimates by introduce a change of variables with invertible functions. They have previously been applied successfully in computer vision to enable more flexible posterior distributions of image data. In this work, we present our preliminary results for the effects normalizing flows can have on existing latent variable neural machine translation models as a means to improve translation quality.

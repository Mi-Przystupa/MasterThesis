\chapter{Preface}

All of the work presented henceforth was conducted jointly by the Machine Learning lab in the Department of Computer Science and the Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing lab in the School Information both located at the University of British Columbia, Point Grey Campus. All work was performed under the supervision of Dr. Muhammad Abdul-Mageed and Dr. Mark Schmidt. Guidance was provided by Frank Wood on direction towards latent variable models for machine translation. Aaron Mischkin provided code snippets to help visualize the latent variables. William Harvey helped with understanding the \textit{Pyro} probabilistic programming language in which all models were implemented. Preliminary results were presented at the Invertible and Normalizing Flows workshop as part of the 2019 International Conference of Machine Learning. The remainder of this thesis, including writing, figures, experiments, implementation were conducted by the author of this thesis.
